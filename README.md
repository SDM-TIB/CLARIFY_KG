# CLARIFY

Mapping rules that are required to generate KG based on [CLARIFY unified schema](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/CLARIFYUnifiedSchema) from processed data, and configuration files required by [SDM-RDFizer](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/SDM-RDFizer) to transfer data into RDF triples. The output of materializing them is the CLARIFY Knowledge Graph consisting of RDF triples created from drug, drug_predications, publication, lung cancer (the latest versions provided by UPM), and breast cancer clinical data and their annotations.
